# Python_Warehouse_Project

This Python script implements a warehouse management program for a garment storage facility. It provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that allows users to perform various operations on the inventory data, such as:

Displaying Stock Information:

View all items in the warehouse.
Search for a specific item by its unique ID.
Adding New Items:

Input new stock details, including ID, type, name, quantity, and price.
Ensure no duplicate entries for the same ID.
Updating Existing Items:

Modify specific attributes (e.g., type, name, stock, or price) of an existing item based on its ID.
Deleting Items:

Remove items from the inventory by their unique ID.
Exiting the Program:

Prompt users to confirm before exiting.
The inventory data is managed in a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item in the warehouse with fields such as nomorID, jenis, nama, stock, and harga. The script includes validation checks for user inputs to enhance the robustness of the operations.

This program is ideal for small businesses looking for a simple and effective way to manage their warehouse inventory.
